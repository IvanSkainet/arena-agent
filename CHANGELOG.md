# Changelog

## v3.0.0 — 2026-06-16

### Milestone
- Stable modular Arena Unified Bridge v3 release.
- `master` is promoted to the modular v3 code line; `v2.12.0` remains available as the old monolith tag/release.
- `unified_bridge.py` remains a 98-line compatibility/CLI entrypoint; implementation lives in focused `arena/*` modules.

### Added
- `docs/MOBILE_SUPPORT_ROADMAP.md` for post-v3.0 Android/mobile planning.

### Fixed
- Windows installer stale SCM/NSSM service cleanup when Scheduled Task mode is active.
- Linux installer local-source install path and v3 branch defaulting.
- Windows ZIP skill installation handle locking around temporary ZIP files.
- Cross-platform test portability issues found during Windows RC validation.

### Validation
- Linux/CachyOS fresh install from `v3.0.0-rc.1` release ZIP: PASS.
- Linux/CachyOS source `pytest -q`: PASS, 400 tests.
- Linux/CachyOS endpoint smoke: PASS, including KDE/Wayland desktop windows, active window and screenshot.
- Linux/CachyOS stress v4 with restart: PASS=18.
- Windows fresh install from `v3.0.0-rc.1` release ZIP: PASS.
- Windows source `pytest -q`: PASS, 400 tests.
- Windows endpoint smoke: PASS.
- Windows stress v4 with restart: PASS=15 SKIP=3 (`pending-win32` desktop backend skips expected).

## v3.0.0-rc.1 — 2026-06-16

### Milestone
- Release candidate for the stable modular `v3.0.0` line.
- v3 remains API-compatible with the v2 bridge surface while replacing the old monolith with focused modules.

### Changed
- Version metadata updated from `3.0.0-beta.2` to `3.0.0-rc.1`.
- README now describes the RC stabilization state and the current 98-line `unified_bridge.py` compatibility entrypoint.
- Added a mobile/Android support roadmap for post-`v3.0.0` planning without making mobile work a stable-release blocker.

### Fixed
- Windows ZIP skill installation no longer trips over `NamedTemporaryFile` handle locking.
- Windows test coverage now uses shell-portable Python commands instead of POSIX-only quoting/tools.
- Memory tests now force garbage collection before temporary directory cleanup to avoid lingering SQLite handles on Windows.

### Validation target
- Local `pytest -q` must pass before tagging.
- Fresh release-zip install checks are required on CachyOS/Linux and Windows before promoting this RC to stable.
- Expected stress gates: CachyOS `PASS=18`; Windows `PASS=15 SKIP=3` with `pending-win32` desktop skips documented.

## v3.0.0-beta.2 — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- Windows installer removes stale `ArenaUnifiedBridge` SCM/NSSM services when falling back to Scheduled Task mode.
- Windows uninstaller removes stale SCM service entries even when NSSM is not installed.
- Windows installer Funnel summary now falls back to checking the public `/health` endpoint when `tailscale funnel status` output is unavailable to the installer context.

### Validation
- Windows 10 fresh install/reinstall smoke: PASS.
- Windows 10 stress v4 with restart: PASS=15 SKIP=3 (`pending-win32` desktop backend skips are expected).
- Linux/CachyOS fresh install from beta zip: PASS.
- Linux/CachyOS stress v4 with restart: PASS=18.

## v3.0.0-beta.1 — 2026-06-16

### Milestone
- First beta of the modular v3 bridge line.
- Linux/CachyOS and Windows 10 validation both pass on the modular architecture.

### Fixed
- Windows installer no longer prints the broken `Bridge is healthyHEALTH_VERSION` message.
- Windows installer no longer fails on repeated installs with a missing `cloudflared_done` label.
- Linux/macOS installer now defaults to the v3 modular branch and supports local-source installs, avoiding accidental v2.12 installs from `master` during v3 testing.
- Linux/macOS uninstaller now stops Cloudflared quick tunnel processes and removes bundled `cloudflared` binaries when present.

### Improved
- Windows and Linux installers now report/verify optional component status more clearly: cloudflared, SuperPowers, BrowserAct, Camoufox and Tailscale Funnel.
- Added architecture boundary tests and unified bridge compatibility surface tests.
- Added `docs/MODULE_MAP.md`, `docs/V3_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, and `docs/V3_STABILIZATION_AUDIT.md`.

### Validation
- Local `pytest -q`: PASS, 400 tests.
- Live CachyOS/KDE `pytest -q`: PASS, 400 tests.
- Live CachyOS/KDE stress v4 with restart: PASS=18.
- Windows 10 stress v4 with restart: PASS=15 SKIP=3 (desktop backend intentionally pending-win32).

## v3.0.0-alpha.1 — 2026-06-16

### Milestone
- First modular Arena Unified Bridge release.
- `unified_bridge.py` reduced from the old monolithic implementation to a thin compatibility/CLI entrypoint (~165 lines).
- Public REST, MCP, WebSocket, dashboard, gateway and installer behavior remain compatibility-preserving.

### Changed
- Split the bridge into focused `arena/*` domain packages: app factory, route registry, contexts, wiring, browser/CDP, desktop, service, system, memory, skills, tasks, observability, admin, MCP, TLS, sandbox and cluster modules.
- Added `arena/legacy_imports/*` and `arena/wiring/legacy_*` compatibility layers so existing `import unified_bridge as ub` integrations continue to work during the v3 transition.
- Updated README project layout and contribution guidance for the modular architecture.

### Validation
- Full local and live `pytest -q` pass.
- Live CachyOS/KDE `dev/stress-test-v4.py --restart` pass with `Summary: PASS=18`.

## v2.12.0 — 2026-06-10

### Milestone
- Stable monolith baseline before the planned v3 modularization work.
- Windows and CachyOS/KDE have both passed the capability-aware v4 stress suite, including restart lifecycle checks.

### Changed
- `dev/stress-test-v4.py` is now non-persistent by default: it lists tasks but does not submit queue tasks unless `--task-roundtrip` is explicitly requested.
- Task roundtrip now uses `echo stress-test-v4 noop`, which is valid on Windows cmd and POSIX shells.

### Added
- Added `docs/STRESS_TEST_V4.md` with local/remote, restart, and task-roundtrip usage.

## v2.11.6 — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- Linux `/v1/restart` now prefers a transient `systemd-run --user` unit, so the restart helper survives `arena-bridge.service` cgroup cleanup and can reliably restart the bridge.

### Notes
- The previous detached shell helper remains as fallback for non-systemd Linux environments.

## v2.11.5 — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- `install.sh` no longer references an unset `$PYTHON` variable before Python discovery while reading the bridge version; it now uses a local `VERSION_PY` probe.

### Improved
- `install.sh` re-executes itself under `bash` when invoked as `sh install.sh`, matching the script's intended shell and avoiding shell-mismatch failures.

## v2.11.4 — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- Windows `/v1/restart` now uses the SCM/NSSM restart path only when the Windows service is actually running. Stale stopped services no longer block Scheduled Task relaunch.
- The Windows Scheduled Task restart helper now force-kills the previous bridge PID before relaunching the task, preventing orphaned `python.exe` bridge processes.

### Added
- Added `dev/stress-test-v4.py`, a capability-aware cross-platform smoke/stress test runner for REST/core/hardware/service/skills/tasks/CDP/desktop/restart checks.

## v2.11.3 — 2026-06-10

### Added
- Added `/v1/capabilities`, a stable agent-facing map of available OS/service/browser/desktop/hardware capabilities and selected backends.

### Improved
- Windows installer version detection now uses `_arena_helper.py` / `arena/constants.py`, fixing `Bridge vunknown` after the version constant moved out of `unified_bridge.py`.
- Windows install health verification now prints the actual `/health.version`.
- Windows CIM/PowerShell inventory probes force UTF-8 output and normalize common CIM date formats.
- Windows service/status endpoints distinguish stale stopped services from active Scheduled Tasks and include command lines for bridge-related Python processes.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for installer helper version detection and `/v1/capabilities` route registration.

## v2.11.2 — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- `/v1/skills/uninstall` now accepts safe third-party skill basenames beginning with `_`, so it can remove every safe `third_party/<name>` entry that `/v1/skills` can list while still rejecting traversal and core/category skills.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for underscore-prefixed third-party skill names.

## v2.11.1 — 2026-06-10

### Improved
- `/v1/hardware` now exposes additional read-only device context: physical/block storage devices, PCI/PNP devices, USB devices, and thermal/sensor facts where available.
- KDE Plasma Wayland window discovery no longer depends on `QFile` inside KWin scripting. The script now prints tokenized JSON to the user journal, which the bridge reads back, and still falls back to `wmctrl`/`xdotool`.

### Fixed
- `/v1/skills/uninstall` now accepts the same third-party names returned by `/v1/skills` (`third_party/<name>`) as well as bare third-party names, while rejecting core/category skills and path traversal.

### Removed
- Removed the broken test-only `skills/third_party/weather` skill from the production tree.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for hardware device sections and third-party skill-name normalization.

## v2.11.0 — 2026-06-10

### Added
- Added `/v1/hardware` as the canonical rich hardware/system inventory endpoint. It is backed by `scripts/inventory.py`, returns normalized JSON for agents and GUI consumers, and keeps `/v1/hwinfo` as a backward-compatible alias.
- Added short `/v1/cdp/*` aliases for the existing `/v1/browser/cdp/*` endpoints to reduce agent/tool 404s when shorter CDP paths are inferred from docs.

### Improved
- Unified the old split hardware collectors: motherboard/BIOS, CPU, memory modules, GPU/NVIDIA telemetry, disks, network, displays, runtimes, package managers, and browsers now come from one inventory source.
- `/v1/desktop/windows` now tries native KDE/KWin scripting on Plasma Wayland before falling back to `wmctrl` and `xdotool`, improving Wayland window discovery without requiring `kdotool`.
- `/v1/browser/cdp/session/check` now returns HTTP 200 with `connected: false` and actionable details when CDP is disconnected, instead of treating the normal disconnected state as a malformed request.
- Runtime version probing is quieter for tools such as `lua` and partial `dotnet` installs.

### Fixed
- Fixed Windows CIM inventory collection: `_get_cim_json()` no longer calls `_run(..., shell=True)` on a helper that did not support `shell`, which previously caused Windows hardware sections to silently return empty data.
- Fixed Windows display inventory (`screens` was referenced before assignment) and expanded Windows logical disk/GPU/RAM CIM property selection.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for the inventory runner, noisy version filtering, and hardware normalization/NVIDIA merge path.

## v2.10.3 — 2026-06-08

### Security
- Hardened `arena/security.py::_validate_url` against SSRF bypasses in browser fetch endpoints (`/v1/browser/read`, `/dump`, `/fetch`, `/head`).
- Blocked obfuscated internal hosts including `127.1`, octal IPv4 (`0177.0.0.1`), decimal integer IPv4 (`2130706433`), hex IPv4 (`0x7f000001`), IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback, and `localhost.localdomain`.
- Blocked metadata/internal hostnames such as `metadata.google.internal`, bare `metadata`, `.internal`, and `.local` names.
- Added DNS resolution defense-in-depth: every A/AAAA result is checked for private, loopback, link-local, reserved, multicast, or unspecified addresses before fetch.

### Tests
- Added regression tests for the reported SSRF bypass payloads.

## v2.10.2 — 2026-06-08

First release built with CI, an expanded test suite, and safe-by-construction
release packaging. No runtime feature changes — focused on correctness,
security of the release process, and developer experience.

### Fixed
- `scripts/mcp_stream_server.py`: added missing `import shutil` — the browser
  screenshot tool called `shutil.which()` without importing it, which would
  raise `NameError` when invoked (found by the new lint pass).
- `unified_bridge.py`: import `Dict`/`Optional` from `typing` (referenced in
  annotations but never imported) and removed a redundant local `urlparse`
  import.

### Security
- **Release packaging is now safe by construction.** `scripts/pack_release.py`
  previously could include `token.txt`, `users.json`, `audit.jsonl`,
  `requests.jsonl`, and root-level `bridge.log` in the public release archive.
  It now ships only git-tracked files (sensitive files are git-ignored) plus an
  explicit `cloudflared` bundle and runtime-dir placeholders, and asserts the
  archive contains no sensitive names before finishing.

### Tests / CI
- Added GitHub Actions CI: pytest on Python 3.10–3.13 plus a ruff lint pass
  (critical correctness rules enforced as blocking; full rule set informational).
- Added `tests/test_security.py` (60 tests) covering the safety-critical
  surface: command blocklist, desktop-input-injection guard, SSRF validation,
  audit redaction, token generation, and Bearer auth.

### Developer experience / repository hygiene
- Removed the bundled ~39 MB `cloudflared` binary from version control; the
  installers now fetch the platform-correct binary on demand.
- Added `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` (explicit dependencies, ruff &
  pytest configuration); installers install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Added `.editorconfig` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Moved `AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` to `docs/` and `stress-test-v3.sh` to `dev/`;
  corrected the README structure section to match the real layout.

## v2.10.1 — 2026-06-08

### Installer transparency / anti-false-positive
- `install.bat` and `install.sh` now show a prominent background-service transparency notice before registering/updating any background service, scheduled task, systemd unit, or launchd agent.
- Installers now require explicit confirmation before service registration. Use `ARENA_ACCEPT_BACKGROUND=1` or `ARENA_ASSUME_YES=1` for unattended automation.
- README documents expected background processes and legacy helper names (`local_bridge.py`, `mcp_ws_server.py`, `web_gateway.py`, `agentctl task-watch`), plus PowerShell/Linux/macOS inspection and cleanup commands.
- Runtime bridge version bumped to `2.10.1` so `/health` and `/v1/version` identify this release.

## v2.10.0 — 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- Closed the control-lease bypass where `/v1/exec` could still inject desktop input while control was paused/revoked by blocking input-injection tools (`ydotool`, `xdotool` key/mouse/type, `wtype`, `dotool`, etc.) under a paused/revoked lease while keeping non-input shell diagnostics available.
- Made `/v1/desktop/screenshot` honor `format`, `scale`, `max_width`, and `quality` parameters. The endpoint can now return JPEG/WebP/downscaled images instead of always returning full-size PNG.
- Hardened `/v1/exec` safety patterns against obvious secret reads and reverse-shell payloads (`~/.ssh/id_*`, `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`, `.aws/credentials`, `token.txt`, `/etc/shadow`, `/dev/tcp`, `nc -e`, etc.).
- Made `/v1/desktop/type` more reliable on KDE/Wayland with `ensure_latin` (default `true`), switching the keyboard layout to the first/Latin layout before typing to avoid RU/other-layout keycode corruption.
- Added `/openapi.json` as an OpenAPI alias to improve API discoverability, and documented the new desktop screenshot/type parameters.

### Documentation / transparency
- Added a prominent README section explaining expected background processes, Windows scheduled tasks/services, legacy helper names, and manual cleanup commands so the project is not mistaken for malware.
- `install.bat` and `install.sh` now show an explicit background-service transparency notice and require confirmation before installing/updating the service. Set `ARENA_ACCEPT_BACKGROUND=1` or `ARENA_ASSUME_YES=1` for unattended automation.

### Notes
- `owner-shell` remains a trusted/local-owner profile; these safety patterns reduce common foot-guns but are not a substitute for a sandbox or least-privilege deployment.
- For vision agents, recommended screenshot parameters are now `format=jpeg&scale=0.5&quality=80` or `format=jpeg&max_width=1280&quality=80`.
